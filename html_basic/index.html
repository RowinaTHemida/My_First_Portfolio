    <h1>Welcome to My First Webpage</h1>

    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>Hi! I’m Rowina, a Front-End Developer and Robotics Instructor. I’m currently studying HTML and building awesome web projects.</p>
    
    <h3>My Learning Goals</h3>
    <p>My goal is to master HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to become a professional web developer and educator in tech.</p>

    <p>Through ALX, I’m learning how to create real websites from scratch and bring ideas to life through code.</p>
    
    <p>This is my very first official webpage, and I’m proud to start this journey with simple but strong foundations.</p>
